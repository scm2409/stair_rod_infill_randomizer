# Quality Evaluator Criteria Weights
#
# These weights determine the relative importance of each quality criterion
# in the overall fitness score. All weights should sum to approximately 1.0.
#
# Criteria:
#   - hole_uniformity: Prefer arrangements where all holes are approximately the same size
#   - incircle_uniformity: Prefer arrangements where hole incircles have similar radii
#   - angle_distribution: Penalize rods that are nearly vertical or at extreme angles
#   - anchor_spacing_horizontal: Prefer evenly distributed anchors on horizontal frame segments
#   - anchor_spacing_vertical: Prefer evenly distributed anchors on vertical frame segments
