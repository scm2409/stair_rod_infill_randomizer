# Quality Evaluator Configuration
#
# The Quality Evaluator uses multiple weighted criteria to assess
# infill arrangement quality. It provides detailed fitness scoring
# for optimization and rejects arrangements that exceed maximum hole area
# or fall below minimum hole area.
#
# Acceptance Criteria Thresholds:
#   - max_hole_area_cm2: Maximum allowed hole area in square centimeters
#     Any arrangement with a hole larger than this will be rejected.
#     Default: 10000.0 cm² (100cm x 100cm)
#   - min_hole_area_cm2: Minimum allowed hole area in square centimeters
#     Any arrangement with a hole smaller than this will be rejected.
#     Default: 10.0 cm² (prevents tiny slivers)
#
# Quality Criteria Weights:
#   These weights determine the relative importance of each quality criterion
#   in the overall fitness score. All weights should sum to approximately 1.0.
#
#   - hole_uniformity: Prefer arrangements where all holes are approximately the same size
#   - incircle_uniformity: Prefer arrangements where hole incircles have similar radii
#   - angle_distribution: Penalize rods that are nearly vertical or at extreme angles
#   - anchor_spacing_horizontal: Prefer evenly distributed anchors on horizontal frame segments
#   - anchor_spacing_vertical: Prefer evenly distributed anchors on vertical frame segments
